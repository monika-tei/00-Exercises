Star
- Remember Model (the data model), View(filtering, sorting, stars), Controller(what I can do as a user-click sort/filter, star btn)
- we need to separate into 3 parts to define the process
1.Model - add star to animal
2. View - add visible fixed star to each animal in the list
2. get the star status from the model and display that in the list (selected, not selected)
3. Controller
3. user interactivity to turn stars on & off.

Winners

-Model
    - add winner status to animal
-View
    - add visible winners fixed values
    - show winner in the list
    - get winner status from the model and display that
-Controller
    - fake winners, add a toggle button to make each animal a winner
    - design the logic for the rules ... might need drawing
    - implement the logic with lots of basic functions (step by step)
    - add user interface to logic (includes view again)
    - dynamic dialogue boxes;
